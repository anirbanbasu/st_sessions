    :point_left: Change to the other page. You will see that the session state variables
    have been reset to their initial values. Is this the expected behaviour :scream:?

    **Note** that there are two sets of session state variables. One set is shadowing the other.
    The shadow set is connected to the user interface elements as keys. The other set isn't.

    For details, check the code of this app on 
    [GitHub](https://github.com/anirbanbasu/st_sessions/).
